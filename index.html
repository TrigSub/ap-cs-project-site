            <h2>"Find the Yellow Dot!" Scratch Project</h2>
            <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/325811124/">Find The Yellow Dot!</a></p> 
            <p>Want some fun finding a yellow dot in a new maze game? This game is as simple as the title suggests. Just find the yellow dot! This maze game has 5 different areas and when the game begins, the yellow dot is placed in a random location in a random area. This was used as a summer homework project for AP CSP at BHS.

                    <p>This is the Mandala Generator! I made this as a project on "Snap!". It utilizes the making of one singular shape (a decagon) and a loop which rotates the shape 360/10 degrees and re-draws the shape afterwards.

                    <p>This is the first version of my drawing app, Art Studio, made for my AP CSP class Create practice project! This was made using the "Snap!" block-based programming language. It was made with the intention of allowing a younger audience a platform to draw and be creative! There are multiple features on the app with a menu featuring credits and even a save drawing feature. The clear interface allows for 3 different screens, in which the color menu shows different colors, a paint bucket, erase, and more. The shapes menu shows how to make different shappes and even includes a custom polygon-maker! The home menu takes you home (obviously) and the settings menu shows the settings of the screen and a learning interface. A challenge I faced in making this was using trigonometry to make the custom polygon-maker, which was all worth it and fun to derive the math formulas with previous knowledge!  </p>
